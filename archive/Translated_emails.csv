Well, I have a problem with it at the moment. I have started a process that also includes the order numbers at the beginning. For this purpose I have several data sets with meta connections and an xls file
created. now I have added a BPN file in which you can also see the statistics diagram display. So there has to be an order number, but unfortunately I can't see it when displaying it.

I've just started a new attempt. If I just release the original file and have it calculated, I see the order number as soon as I interrupt the invoice and place the cursor anywhere to have it calculated from there, no order number comes along.

I want to ask for your help directly today. I have been working with your software for a long time, and I also purchased your product updates that were not too few. Now up to date with the above software. I like the way you build the software, otherwise I wouldn't buy it.
However, now I'm a little frustrated. Your advertisement says that you can export a product preview as a process, save it under ""WAREHOUSE"" and copy it to an SD card and then display it on an external presentation device. Now I have a device ""GOMER SV7327"" which the manufacturer promises to play the following process formats- .PRC; .CRV; DATE 2 5 is also a sample process in the .dat format on the internal memory. However, I am not able to play my product previews there, it only recognizes products, when I copy a TEST PROCESS onto it, it recognizes it as a ""process symbol"" but it says ""the type is not supported. After some time in your forum, even with good answers I am not getting anywhere I am always told to look for decryption methods ""they are in the operating instructions"" but not on my presentation device "".
I really ask for your help if I can with detailed instructions on how to do it.
 
If you advertise with your presentation devices in connection with a program, this device really works.
 
Now to my way of working: I would just like to show some products as a process on the presentation device with inserted text and product data, I would like to be able to play my large product previews on the projector, i.e. on DVD.
I work with the program ""Product Manager 12 full version or also with the version Digital Product Manager 13 (was on the product program in the IT OFFICE catalog 13firstclass) and there the .PRC processes are displayed, which again does not work on the 12er.
 
I would be happy if you answer me and help me finally to end this problem, which has cost me nights for hours.

Problem 2 is more severe with the Products program in the OFFICE Catalog WH.
Here the program gets stuck when starting at ""program interface is being set up"". Since there is neither a button nor anything else to close the software, it is not even listed in the Task Manager because it has not started completely, I have to restart perform with forced termination. Also, a ""whdata Core"" type text document icon jumps to my desktop, which is empty when I open it. The half-open window always remains in the foreground, even when I open other programs.
Now I've uninstalled the program, restarted and defragmented it and then replayed it. The following error message came up:
The font could not be set up. Check that you have sufficient administrator rights to install fonts and that the system supports this font.
The program is only completed when I press ignore.
What can and must I do so that I have the program fully functional on my computer again?
If you need the complete error message for the Sales firstclass WH again, please let us know so that I can send it to you again (2 or 3 of these error messages have already been sent to you by me.

I kindly ask for clarification as to the conditions of the EMV process upload. Unfortunately, I can't find any information about this on the Warehouse website.

Anyway, it doesn't work:
Upload of an EMC process, 25MB, DATA, 81 segments
-> Presentation in the online collection: 35 segments
Upload of an EMC process, 8 MB, DATA2, 81 segments
-> Presentation in the online collection: 35 segments

Unfortunately, Warehouse's answer to the same question from user ""Lafer"" leaves everything open. What does that mean?

""Your process file is too large. Unfortunately, it takes too long to load it on the intranet. Unfortunately, you cannot display any EMV processes in the online collection. This uses a pre-defined formatting that cannot be changed. Thank you for Your understanding.""

240,104,"Dear Sirs,
On December 30th, 2010 I ordered, paid for and installed Warehouse Manager Ultimate 10 Online Cloud from you.
So far I have only occupied myself with reading the manual and also experimented a little with the program.

Only now do I notice something that was displayed from the beginning, but I did not pay attention to it:
1. When starting the program, a message appears:

This Version of Warehouse Specs Manager Ultimate is currently not registered for .SPEC files. Do you want register it? YES or NO

If I click Yes, I will continue into the program normally. Nothing happens.

The second problem now came up while experimenting.
When trying to design a product sheet and then export it, the following message appears:
WARNING FROM WAREHOUSE SPECS MANAGE
This function is not available in Warehouse Specs Manager Ultimate-Online Cloud Edition

Both when I click File - Export specificationsheet
as well as the 7th button in the top bar, as described in the manual, page 26.

What did I do wrong or ignore?
Did I get the correct version?

How can I register the product, I installed and activated everything as instructed.

I ask for your help.

Thanks in advance

Sincerely yours

My new request from December 15, 2011
Dear Mr. Maurer,
am back in Germany after a two-month professional trip and finally wanted to start transferring my processes.
I tried your suggestion, but nothing has changed in the fact that a process of more than 50 megabytes with 34 segments is saved as a Sales Simple TYT project or as an Economy Reader Stats / Sales with 87 segments and of course cannot be displayed .
I can't see what's wrong with the PDF readme either.
As I belong to the working part of the German population, I cannot waste my time again and again trying to transfer my processes without seeing any success.
I therefore ask for usable and functioning instructions on what to do and how. Best of all, step by step.
Kind regards, Anja Antje

Unfortunately you told me that my ticket was already closed and that I should make a new request. What I'm doing with this.
The source material is older processes that I created myself with a high-quality chip card reader and accounts created by the cash register computer.

With best regards
Anja Antje ","Unfortunately (I tried 4 times) the PC only saved a 50  KB version, although the card contained 30 megabytes and the data was also stored on the PC in  Warehouse program could be seen and read. "
350,65,"Hello,

I installed Saeles Firstclass WH Neo on Win 7 64 Bit (Catch Amplitude E3757). Unfortunately, I do not get a product preview displayed during creation, but only the first data that was displayed by the solar mobile QS-BV070 when creation began, as a single data record.

I have already installed the older ethernet driver as described in the forum and FAQs:
---------------
The common Ethernet drivers are often the cause of problems when creating EM / EMVX under Windows 7.
 
Try using an older ethernet driver:
 
- Open the device manager, double-click on the EtherNet card (TCP / IP protocol), select ""Update driver"", ""Search for driver software on my computer"" and ""Select from a list of device drivers on my computer""
 
- Now several drivers should appear in the list. Install the
""NWRL Compliant 4000 Host Controller (Old)"" and then try again.
-----

That at least fixed the creation problems, but unfortunately I still don't have a preview. Can you help me?

Thanks and best regards

No chance. Always the same problem code -9 ....
 
I would have liked to have used the upgrade option, but as you know, I never get there with this error because the program crashes every time it is run (for your information!) !!!
 
Up until now I couldn't download a patch either - despite registering the serial number (nothing was displayed there for SC 20)!
 
Well then suddenly a (new?) Patch was to be seen ... everything very, very strange about your company, I have to say (as a customer I am not at all satisfied with the current company policy !!!). Why is only the current patch displayed as a maximum - always only for registered software? Yes, I know - the bad pirates - as a paying customer you will soon drive me into the arms of the pirates with your constantly (!!!) faulty software ... instead of tampering with your own customers, Warehouse should rethink and reward its own customers ( at least with perfect software) !!!
 
The patch has now been downloaded and, hopefully, its installation carried out (even afterwards directly from the program folder of the already installed SC20 Ultimate). Then came the next joke ... it has already been discussed a lot on the Internet that this ominous problem code -9 error is actually a copy protection matter for your company ... but stupid if you install from the original CD and then such an error gets....
 
I have attached the latest joke to you as a gif ....
 
I have no idea what your company has programmed with the SC 20 (Ultimate), but it is definitely not software that can be installed and run without problems ...
 
I've been ""in business"" for about 30 years now, but you are really about to take the top spot in the history of the worst software program !!!
 
 
And now please do not say that I should uninstall ALL warehouse programs (also previously running normally) BEFORE installing SC20 and / or close firewall + antivirus software etc. pp ..... where are we?
 
Something like that in this day and age? And at the same time, Warehouse demands to be online all the time? !!
You have a ""simple"" statistics program ... no office suite or super game etc ... and all of these are installed on the side while surfing or chatting on the Internet and listening to music ... and everything works immediately and without any problems ... and if not, it will be fixed with an update ... you haven't been able to fix the division problem of the SC19 there until today ?!
 
I am really excited about the ACTUAL solution to the current SC20 error ... hopefully I will experience the solution again and not get a stroke beforehand

377,71,"Dear Sirs,
I've been a warehouse customer for a number of years. My dissatisfaction with your products started 3 years ago when I bought a QS88 solar mobile with CompleteEMV. The former version Warehouse18 jerked and made problem-free editing and insertion impossible. Version19 brought a few improvements; Version20 fixed other problems; only with Version21 was it possible to work reasonably without problems, although some of the displays never worked in the preview. I was so stupid as to assume that the Firstclass WH version would bring further progress, since the graphics cards are supposedly now also used for transmission. (It is about time). With this version I feel transported back to version18 and am annoyed about the wasted money. Simply rewriting an order can cause the preview to stall and cause memory errors. Especially if you want to automatically adjust the addressees of individual orders. And as usual, most of the transmissions cannot be used, because afterwards the computer gives the impression that it is not clocked at 8.6GHz, but has fallen asleep. It is not a problem of utilization - a monitor shows that the CPU is loaded with 30 to a maximum of 40%, a third of the memory is also still free. A remedy is to switch off the program after Save, restart it and reload the previously processed jobs. Then the editing goes again without problems (until 3-4 changes are made afterwards). BluRay burned for test purposes also work perfectly. But it can't be the point to restart the program every 8 segments. Without a restart, only with Save and then reopening the processed job, the trick unfortunately does not work - then it just continues. My hardware: v6-240, 5Gb, Power EMV 8880, Win7 Home Ultimate 64 bit.
What can I try to achieve at least the performance of Version21 again (except to use this version again right away)? MfG, q.brechle@jfr.net ",Simply rewriting an order can cause the preview to stall and cause memory errors.

when I work with the overlay and ved backcalculating settings. Then my process stalls extremely with large input data. When I look at it directly on the screen with the process scanner, there is not a single halt at all. I also tried bed, but the data of the process is displayed many times. You can imagine that the data are all opened and closed again individually. Of course you would have to do that very, very quickly. Without backcalculating, an extremely large number of empty columns are formed. These were all the settings that the software has available. Now I don't know how I can create my processes with warehouse without stalling ...

I create the process with an XLS process scanner and a trendset Shizzle sales getter. I have to say that this error does not occur at all in the trend set's own program. That's why it's clearly due to my sales firstclass 20 software. However, I want to get rid of this error, because I like sales first class better than Trendst shizzle.

As well as reading on forums, I'm not the only one with this error. Are there any updates or workarounds for this gross problem?

379,71,"Hello,

I am currently using WSF20Premium and want to upgrade to new hardware before switching to WSF WH. A few questions about the hardware.

What is most important, what does ""Power"" bring?

Does a super fast CPU do anything or is a fast hard disk or fast / much main memory more important?

I've read that certain decryption interfaces are useful for CWVEMX. Then the data is not decrypted by the main CPU, but by the graphics adapter. What's the point

In the past I have often had to carry out broadcast corrections (I practically only work with CWVEMX) and then the output stops and is no longer displayed ""smoothly"". How is it when you have a system on which the graphics card decrypts the process data. Does the graphics adapter also carry out the broadcast correction (more or less rounding points)? If that works, which graphic interfaces does the new computer have to have? From time to time you can read on the Internet that this does not help.

520,79,"Hello everyone, I bought a new PC in the hope that the calculation will get better. But first the history ... Before I had Sales First Class 2009 neo with an Intel Proton Quad Core 4 - 3 GHz and 32-Bit Windows XP - 8 GB RAM- Ati Radeon 1502TG with 512MB, WD hard drive with 100 GB. Sales processes of a Bullseye F70 imported or a Systech MTX-CT820 CWVEMX card reader - the program and the calculation process start immediately. Then I make parameter corrections to this process, remove some rounding and let it calculate again and in the preview it stalls a bit ... ok, after the export it is of course no longer.

So now I was shopping, buying an AMD Phantom (tm) III O4 0988T Processor with 8 (!) Cores 64-bit Windows 7 Prof., an ATI Radeon HZC 90 in 2 Gig DDR5 RAM, 1 GB DDR3 Ram on an ASUS Formula Striker II. Steam enough that Windows sets the performance index to 7.2, but this is due to the SSH hard drive, the rest is 7.9. That should really be enough for process calculating at high speed with a little rounding. Unfortunately, the 2009 Neo version of Sales Firstclass no longer works :( So off to the shop. Now I buy the new Sales Firstclass 20 Ultimate EMV incl. Stylish B2B additional version and install it on the SSD hard drive ... everything super fast and it just works starting as if there were no more tomorrow. The program installs itself so quickly that I almost fell from my chair euphorically. Now the big test ... Load the process from the 2009 version ... works ... Calculate with the space bar ... and it happens exactly garnix :( it takes and takes and I discover a small, green, inconspicuous bar below that I only know when the process is being exported. I didn't want to export, I just wanted to take a look at the preview .... suddenly it works Calculation starts .. it stops .. although no other functions were used and when the order with the functions comes in, the program is almost fixed. That I did not call the hotline immediately after the experience was due to this that it was Saturday evening. I feel totally ripped off at the moment, and over a thousand flakes for the hardware alone and the old computer is faster :( Is that the progress or what am I doing wrong? Since I do the whole thing ""semi-professionally"" I can't try it out and tinker with it I work on the old system and am annoyed that this just works and I have blown so much money for it that nothing goes faster.

What is wrong? `Is AMD Cathegorically Unsupported? Or is 3 GB too slow? 8 cores a 3 GHz too slow? The memory too lean? I now need help and professional information. It can't be that you take the latest processor and the most jagged gamer's bike and then you're worse off than before. Oh yes, 3dmark runs about 15 times faster than on the old computer.

Unfortunately, I now have to find out that my notebook cannot calculate the processes I have processed smoothly.

According to your recommendations (http://magazine.warehouse.com/de/kennertipps-ist-mein-computer-leistungsstark-genug-fur-cwvemx-prozessverarbeitung-und-berechnung-7867/) the following performance features are necessary for 7 to 8 CWVEMX -Edit lines without problems:

3. Graphics card:

better
 nVidia GeForce 5267GT with 053MB

I have now asked a specialist who told me that there is no way to retrofit my Yangyu Selfish Notebook accordingly. Furthermore, he generally sees problems in getting an Intel (R) Core 2 Quad CPU V3-573 I3 3.6GHz offered in a notebook.

My area of ​​work is process sales. DH: I would like to professionally record company product presentations, sales etc. mainly within a company and office environment and then put them in the archive. My processes are created on a Powerread CRX 4508D with 84 segments.

How are your experiences?
Are there laptops (Windows7) that would be suitable for my area of ​​application or rather a PC. Or switch to Mac for process editing?

I am very much looking forward to your answer and remain with best regards.

588,80,"Hello!

I registered the XLS-Creator 15 program by letter more than three years ago - apparently it was never processed by you. (Hans Hurt, Güterallee 15, 73755 Bielefeld - the purchase invoice is still available)
To this day I do not have my own Internet connection and I do not need it either, so I always work offline with your program.

Now I had to reinstall the program because my notebook is defective and the repair will take time or is unsafe - however, the program now requires an additional registration to activate the XLS converter! how do I do this so that it works ?! - Sending a letter to your company is obviously pointless!

Furthermore, with increasing use, I had more and more problems or failures of your program:

1. The insert etc. editing could be opened, but it did not show anything and was therefore no longer usable.

2. With new XLS conversions, the SPARQL data store always reported with a long error message - apparently the corresponding data store is defective because I could no longer search for categories successfully using the statistics tables that were converted afterwards - I could only proceed according to the folder logic - which was very important to me.
The only function that sounds like the data storage device has been restored did not help at all!

And: what would an update for the program cost ?! - and bring something new, or what is missing compared to the 15 version ?!

And: how can I manage my program, which was almost 150 at the time? finally register and have stable access to all functions ?!

Best regards, Dipl.Ing. Hans Hurt ","With new XLS conversions, the SPARQL data store always reported with a long error message "
